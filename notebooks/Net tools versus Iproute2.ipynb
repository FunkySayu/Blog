    "# Let's forget about `net-tools` and welcome `iproute2`\n",
    "\n",
    "`iproute2` is a bunch of tools that aim to replace the old commands like `ifconfig`, `route` or `arp` contained in the `net-tools` package. A lot of people are still using `net-tools` but as described in [this official statement](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2009/03/msg00780.html), `net-tools` is intended to deprecation and does not support some new kernel network functionalities. Some linux distribution like Archlinux already [deprecated the `net-tools` utility](https://www.archlinux.org/news/deprecation-of-net-tools/) but still [provide them in their repository](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/i686/net-tools/) for backward compatibility scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beside the lack of functionalities, there is also a lack of efficiency in the `net-tools` package. `net-tools` commands reads informations from the `/proc` directory while `iproute2` uses the Linux kernel interface [Netlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlink) which is much faster."

    "## An example of `iproute2` strenght versus `net-tools`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's compare the `net-tools`' `route` utility and the `ip route` utility. In most of the cases, classic routing is enough for what you want to do. For example if you want to modify the default route, both of `iproute2` and `net-tools` embed this functionality :\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# net-tools version :\n",
    "route add default gw $ip\n",
    "\n",
    "# iproute2 version :\n",
    "ip route add default via $ip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However sometimes you do not want to route your packet only based on the destination adresse of a packet. As said in the [`ip rule` manual](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-rule.8.html) :\n",
    "\n",
    ">In some circumstances we want to route packets differently depending not only on destination addresses, but also on other packet fields: source address, IP protocol, transport protocol ports or even packet payload. This task is called *'policy routing'*."
