    "- If the action is an assignation, the reference will be generated at runtime in the locals\n",
    "- If the action is not an assignation, if an assignation with the same name has been done before, the reference will be resolved at runtime in the locals\n",
    "- If the action is not an assignation, check if the reference has been made in locals of the outer scope until reaching the global scope, then add a closure associated to this reference\n",
    "- If the previous case failed, find the reference at runtime in the globals (and raise a `NameError` if not found).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a closure is detected, a cell will be created in the `func_closure` attribute of the function, containing the reference to the element, and the name of the element will be bind in the code object as a `co_freevars` of the `inner` function, and a `co_cellvars` of the `outer` function.\n",
