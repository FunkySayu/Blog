        <p>During a hackathon organized by the police, we worked on an existing
        project allowing the rescue forces to locate someone using its
        smartphone. The concept was fairly simple, the operator sends a message
        to the victim containing a HTTP link, and once the victim reachs it,
        it locate him and send back the location to the operator.</p>
